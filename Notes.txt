The employee.sql file is an exported test database I was using to aid in testing the application.

Assumptions:
I assumed the forecast data for 3 hour periods was not necessary for this implementation and so the five day forecast information that is presented is the forecast taken at noon on that specific day.

I assumed the city associated with a worker is a valid city in Jamaica and can therefore be used as a parameter for the OpenWeatherMap Api

I assumed the "IT people" would all have the role of "IT" in the database
